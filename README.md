# Tanzania_Tourism_Prediction
The Tanzanian tourism sector plays a significant role in the Tanzanian economy, contributing about 17% to the countryâ€™s GDP and 25% of all foreign exchange revenues. The sector, which provides direct employment for more than 600,000 people and up to 2 million people indirectly, generated approximately $2.4 billion in 2018 according to government statistics.

The objective is to develop a machine learning model to predict a tourist's spending when visiting Tanzania.
